                First, I want to say that the relationship between man and environment is the oldest. Humans have other things available in this environment.

                Nature is a gift of human life. Because of this reason, humans and all living beings on this earth, i.e. animals, birds, animals etc. live together.

                Through this nature, all things like a mountain, mountain, and river have been given as a gift. Without all these, no human or wildlife can imagine their life.

                As we see that wildlife lives in this environment. Animals and birds keep their nest on the trees. Forest is their home. There are distinct types of wildlife in this forest. Whose size, colour, style and lifestyle are different?


                Yet because of this wildlife, the beauty of this nature is further enhanced. Wildlife plays an important role in maintaining the beauty of the environment. Like another country, our country also has the rules and regulations to protect the wildlife for the betterment of earth.

                The wildlife is very important to our nature and existence. Given the importance of forests and wildlife, its maintenance and conservation should be given utmost priority. It should also be clear that wildlife conservation is not possible with the efforts of anyone; only hard work of all will lead to excellent results.

          <h6><b><b><u><i> ABOUT ASHIYANA FOUNDATION </i></u></b></b></h6>


          <p>
            Ashiyana Foundation is founded by visionaries who felt the need to build a free of cost medical facility for the stray animals where the best,
            most advanced, ethical and highly skilled medical care is readily available.

            We, at Ashiyana Foundation truly believe that animals are the real victims on earth.
            They didn’t declare war, they don’t have weapons and they don’t want to destroy humans or impose their religion.
            Their only “crime” is that they exist.
            Keeping the ever rising cases of accidents, cruelty, starvation, illnesses and so on,
            we have built an Intensive Care Unit (ICU), Operation Theatre (OT) & Out Patient Department (OPD) for such animals who suffer each day on the streets of the city.

            Our current set-up in Pune City is our pilot model.
            We plan to expand our horizon by working on building a larger unit for farm animals, a sanctuary for the old and discarded and a shelter home for the ones who cannot survive on the streets of the city.

                Ashiyana foundation truly believes that the best way to reduce animal – human conflict & animal – animal conflict is birth control.
                We conduct ABC surgeries twice a week at our facility & keep the animal for Post Operative care until they are fit to be release back where they were picked up from.
